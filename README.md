## How to install

1. Follow instructions on [Roku developer program](https://developer.roku.com/en-ca/docs/developer-program/getting-started/roku-dev-prog.md). Make sure you succeed with their hello world example first.
1. Clone this repository and `cd` inside it.
1. Download `app.mk` from roku's example to project's parent folder

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rokudev/samples/master/getting%20started/makefile/app.mk -O ../app.mk
```

_if you're on MacOS and you get 'ERROR: Device is not responding to ping.', refer to [rokudev/samples#28](https://github.com/rokudev/samples/issues/28)_.

1. Copy and fill environment variables

```bash
cp .env .env.example
vim .env # or use whatever editor you want here
```

1. Load environment variables

```bash
export $(cat .env | xargs)
```

Note: The above command is the equivalent of running `export WHATHEVER=something` in your shell for each line in the `.env`, you could also `export` them by hand if you prefer.

1. Deploy to your device

```bash
make install
```
